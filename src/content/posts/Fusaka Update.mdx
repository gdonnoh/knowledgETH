Its been a month now since the new Ethereum upgrade Fusaka.<br />
But how are things going??
First, lets dive shortly in what changed:<br />
## EIP-7594
A big problem in the protocol was that to prove that a blob had a piece of information, a node needed to download all the blob.
Now with the implementation of the new networking protocol **PeerDAS**, it allows nodes to perform data avalability sampling, to make sure blob data is all available while
downloading only a subset of the data, like a 1/8 of the total data, made possible by **"Reed-solomon encoding"**, reducing the load of each node and making l2s cheaper.

## EIP-7951
**EIP-7951** enables Ethereum to verify secp256r1 signatures on-chain.
Previously, <u>**Ethereum** could not efficiently verify secp256r1 signatures,</u>
making it impractical to use keys generated by phone secure elements. 
This was a mismatch: security chips <u>implement only standard curves like **secp256r1**</u>, while Ethereum historically relied on **secp256k1.**
With EIP-7951, this gap is removed. Secure elements (like Apple’s Secure Enclave) can now be used to sign Ethereum transactions, effectively turning phones into biometric-protected hardware wallets.

## EIP-7935
**EIP-7935** sets the block gas limit to 60M, allowing each block to include more transactions.  
With more transactions per block, the network can support higher activity, resulting in lower fees and faster inclusion.  
The main trade-off is increased resource requirements for nodes.

## EIP-7917
Another big change in the protocol comes with EIP-7917.
Before, <u>the block proposer was only known at the start of the slot (12s).</u> Only then the validators could do their job, and 
transaction inclusion was only known after block production.
This model caused increased confirmation latency and often failed to fully utilize block capacity.
**EIP-7917 brings near-instant confirmation**, by allowing the chain to know, before block production starts,
who the proposer will be and which transactions are going to be included, <u>with the block being almost ready at the start of the slot.</u>

Here you can find a really good deeper explanation :

## EIP-7642


- you can sign ethereum transaction directly with your phone
- gas cost drops from 500k to 6,900 gas
- you can use your fingerprint or faceid to access your wallets, no more seed phrases

fusaka turn every smartphone into a hardware wallet without using seed phrases.
