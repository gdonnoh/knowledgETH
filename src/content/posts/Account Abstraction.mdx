Account abstraction is a new way to manage accounts on Ethereum. <br />
It allows users to create accounts that :
- are not necessarly controlled by a private key 
- can sign transaction with everything they want (E.g google account)
- make someone else pay !



## How the setup works <a id="AA"></a>

**Create a smart contract that defines "what" can sign transaction.**<br />

Unlike a normal Ethereum transaction, the protocol doesn’t force the signature field, in fact is just arbitrary bytes :

*You are not sending a transaction to an Ethereum node but a "UserOp" to a mempool :*<br />

A "UserOperation" is sent to a dedicated off-chain "mempool", where it is bundled into a single standard transaction 
to be executed by the EntryPoint smart contract.
The mempool wraps each UserOperation in a call, constructs the bundle, and sends it on-chain via the EntryPoint.sol contract.
A *UserOperation* is nothing more than an object containing all the data needed to define the "rules" of the account.

*The EntryPoint contract is the execution router for the entire AA system: it deploys the account when needed and it executes every operation always.*

The entire workflow should look like this :

There are also two add on feature that the EntryPoint contract let you implement in your new account:
- *Signature aggregar (optional) :* A signature aggregator is a mechanism for the bundler to submit multiple UserOperations to the EntryPoint in one transaction,
while paying the cost of signature verification only once instead of once per UserOperation. So if you have this option on, your signature (only if the signature method support aggregation eg BLS) is gonna be included in a batch with other compatible UserOperations present in the mempool at that moment, allowing the bundler to compress all those signatures into a single aggregated signature, making you pay a lot less gas.

- *Pay master (optional) :* The paymaster is basically the entity that pays the gas for the UserOperation, replacing the requirement that the account must hold ETH.

## Externally Owned Account vs Unified Account <a id="VS"></a>

*EOA (classic, pre ERC-4337) : <br />*
- Only an elliptic curve private key (secp256k1) can sign a transaction; Ethereum clients reject anything else.
- Private keys are difficult to store and secure, even for experienced users.
- There is no way to recover a lost private key. Lose it and your funds are gone.

*ERC-4337 (account abstraction layer on top of Ethereum):*
- The "signature" field is just arbitrary bytes, the account contract decides how the signature should look like.
- Alternative methods can be used for transaction signing, such as biometrics or authenticators.
- Recovery methods can be implemented in the smart contract, such as social recovery or backup keys.


## Native Account Abstraction <a id="NAA"></a>


Some chain have Account Abstraction natively, like *ZKsync* :<br />

- *In ZKsync*, there is one unified mempool and transaction flow: all EOA are smart contracts.
If compared to Ethereum, the operator here plays the role of a validator and bundler :

- in the other hand, *Ethereum* has two different mempool for transactions, one for the EOA and one for the UserOps:<br />
