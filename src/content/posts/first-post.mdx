Welcome! This blog will be my running schizo notebook as I learn about Ethereum, zero-knowledge proofs, and the broader Web3 ecosystem.
Each note will start broad, accessible to a larger audience, and then gradually go deeper.
Iâ€™ll mark when the discussion becomes builder-focused and highly technical.

## Topics I expect to cover

- New upcoming cool projects (EIP 7503, ..)
- Everything about ZK (elliptic curves, trusted setups ..)
- How l2s works (deeply)
- Might deploy some cool stuff

## Why

- Get feedback from builders on X
- Share references and snippets I find useful
- Trying to get more people to understand magic crypto world
- I forget a lot lol
